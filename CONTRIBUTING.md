## Licensing of contributions

By submitting a contribution to this repository you agree that your contribution is
provided under the terms of the Apache License 2.0, without additional terms or
conditions, as described in section 5 of that license. There is no Contributor
License Agreement (CLA) and no copyright assignment requirement. You retain the
copyright to your contribution.

## Building and testing

Requirements: CMake 3.21 or newer and a C++20 compiler. The primary exercised
platform is Windows with MSVC (Visual Studio 2022, toolset 19.44 or newer).

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release
ctest --test-dir build -C Release --output-on-failure
```

The build must be warning-free. First-party warnings are errors: MSVC builds with
`/W4 /WX /permissive-`, other compilers with `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Werror`.
Do not disable a warning globally to make a change compile; fix the defect or, when
a warning is genuinely wrong for a specific construct, suppress it narrowly at the
site with a comment that explains why.

Tests must not use timeouts. CTest timeouts, shell timeout wrappers, watchdog
processes, and process-limit wrappers are prohibited. A test that hangs is a defect
to diagnose, not to bound.

## Code quality requirements

- Portable C++20. Standard library only; no third-party dependencies.
- Authoritative calculations use checked integer arithmetic in exact fixed units.
  Floating point is not used for reserve, duration, limit, or comparison.
- Every mutation that depends on current state carries explicit preconditions.
  Stale authority is refused, never merged.
- Observation is not authority. An acknowledgement is not an effect. Persisted
  state is not current evidence. Zero is not unknown. Unsupported is not
  unavailable, and an unknown command is never mapped onto a nearby one.
- Protected-load obligations fail closed. A transition that would drop protection
  is refused unless every binding obligation is explicitly released or suspended.
- Persisted and external input is untrusted: bound sizes before allocating, reject
  malformed, truncated, oversized, wrong-version, wrong-endian, and
  path-manipulated state, and never adopt an unrelated store.
- Concurrency changes must preserve the documented single-lock-level ownership
  model (see the concurrency section of the README) and must keep adapter calls
  outside every internal lock.
- Do not claim behavior that is not proven by an executable check in this
  repository. Label real, synthetic, and unsupported evidence precisely.

## Adding tests

Every behavioral change needs a test. Prefer deterministic tests with injected
logical instants over tests that depend on wall-clock time. Property and randomized
tests must use fixed seeds so failures reproduce exactly.
